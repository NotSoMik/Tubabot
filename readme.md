couple things to consider

1 this code does not work out of the box, you will need to use these commands to install certainpackages for certain commands

1 text to ascii use npm i figlet

2 calculate use npm i mathjs

3 meme use npm i random-puppy

4 weather use npm i weather-js

those will be used for those commands

aslo this bot was for purposes of fun olny and i would not like if Tubabot was used to monotize.

Tubabot was originaly named tubabottest and thats the mane you willl find in old node versions of this project.

there were other bots made for beta, but I decided to scrap and instead just update Tubabot.

I will add a licence soon

This is currently olny for devs

if you obtanied this by other means than github, stop stealing, you are stealing from a 14 year old child.
