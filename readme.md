couple things to consider

this code does not work out of the box, you will need to use these commands to install certain packages for certain commands after installing node.js and making a node project, using npm init

1 text to ascii use npm i figlet

2 calculate use npm i mathjs

3 meme use npm i random-puppy

4 weather use npm i weather-js

5 for warn system use npm i quick.db@7.0.0-b21

6 for economy use npm i parse-ms

those will be used for those commands

aslo this bot was for purposes of fun olny and i would not like if Tubabot was used to monotize.

Tubabot was originaly named tubabottest and thats the mane you will find in old node versions of this project.

there were other bots made for beta, but I decided to scrap and instead just update Tubabot.

I will add a licence soon

This is currently olny for devs

if you obtanied this by other means than github or offical discord, stop stealing, you are stealing from a 14 year old child.
